# BrunswickTL: Spoot's slightly edited MTL repo
Because machines also suffer from occasional strokes \
~~cygae pls dont sue me~~
## Why?

The original full MTL repo was in short, complete dogshit with a whole lot of issues too big to fix.

So here we are... 

The goal here is to use MTL with some edits to make a somewhat readible/understandable slop translation. 

Intended to be use in conjuction to an already existing TL repo *(you know what I mean)*


## Translation Progress
If it doesn't exist here, then I haven't done it or exists in another repo.

Currently working on character system text as my main priority. (Filling the missing stuff from an existing repo)
